### Abstract
The development of high-speed rail had strongly improved the mobility and efficiency of Taiwan's intercity transportation. Nowadays, the pros and cons of the Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) regained the public concern due to its extension plan. The research focused on the comparison of the housing price of Taoyuan and Yunlin and tried to find out how the level of the effect due to THSR. By using the housing price data from “Registering the Actual Selling Price of Real Estate System” and the hedonic price model, the estimation was made by the property, location, and neighborhood attributes. The results of using the log-linear function and box-cox transformation were also compared. The results suggested that high-speed rail did not imply a positive nor negative effect on the region.
